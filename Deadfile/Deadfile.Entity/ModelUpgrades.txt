1. Make the model change.
2. Open the Package Manager Console.
3. Add-Migration <MigrationName>
4. Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration "<PreviousMigrationName>" -TargetMigration "<MigrationName>"
5. Save this output as a script in the Migrations/SQL directory.
6. This will not actually update the database - we want to do that manually. So do that in SQL Server Management Studio, and make any other migrations needed.
7. Tell client to export or back up their data before migration, for safety.
